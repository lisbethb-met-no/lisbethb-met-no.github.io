An overview of resources for the Machine Ocean project.

## Machine Learning Libraries

The project will rely primarily on the following open source machine learning libraries:

| Library | Website | License |
|---------|---------|---------|
| TensorFlow   | [www.tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org/) | Apache 2.0 |
| Keras        | [keras.io](https://keras.io/)                     | MIT |
| Scikit-Learn | [scikit-learn.org](https://scikit-learn.org/)     | BSD |

Other libraries may be added as needed, but the project will avoid proprietary software.

## Source Code

All code used for Machine Ocean is tracked in various [git](https://git-scm.com/about) repositories.
To make contributions, please fork the source code and submit pull requests via GitHub.

Machine Ocean source code should be released under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) as a rule,
